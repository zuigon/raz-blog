title: Accidental file in Git repo

I've accidentally put my password in public git repo... not pushed to remote, though.<br />
I've removed it thanks to git's `filter-branch` command which 'rewrites the history', in my case, iterates
through all commits in `master` branch and executes some code:

    $ git filter-branch --tree-filter \
      "export THEFILE=thin/production_config.yml; \
       if [[ -e $THEFILE ]]; then
         cat $THEFILE | \
         sed 's/group: SECRET/group: users/g' > \
         $THEFILE.new && mv $THEFILE.new $THEFILE
       fi" master

After this git creates backup of original objects in `.git/refs/original/`,<br />
so I must `rm -rf .git/refs/original/`

Finally do `git push origin master --force`<br /><br />
